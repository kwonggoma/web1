<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (World Wide Web, WWW, W3) is a global information space where people can share information through Internet-connected computers. It is often simply called the Web. The term is often synonymous with the Internet, but it is strictly a different concept. The Web is just a service that works on the Internet, such as e-mail. However, since 1993, the Web has been the absolute location of the Internet's architecture.

It is also used to refer to a transport method that uses HTTP protocols, hypertext, and HTML formats to exchange pictures and characters on the Internet.</p>
