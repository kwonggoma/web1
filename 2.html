<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  Dependent sheets or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the [1]languages that describe how the markup language is actually displayed, primarily for HTML andLTML and can also be used in XML. W3C is the standard and has a high degree of freedom when defining layouts and styles.

If the markup language (ex. HTML) is responsible for the body of the website, CSS is responsible for decorating, such as clothing and accessories. That is, changing a CSS file without leaving the HTML structure will make it look like a completely different website.

CSS 3, which is currently being developed, has been added to replace graphic-editing images, such as shadow effects, gradients and deformation. In addition, various animation features have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.
